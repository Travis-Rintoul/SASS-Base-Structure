This directory is the home for all SCSS tools or any third party CSS files you use in your project.
Many developers uses (or used to) bourbon which adds several useful functions to your development environment.
You should add such tools in this folder.
This place is also a home for those css files that you downloaded for any third party libraries you are using in the project.
I like to put reset.css file in this folder, this way it gets imported at very first in the app.scss and I can easily override the styles in other files.
