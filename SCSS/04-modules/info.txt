04-modules : Layouts and modules folder does not have major difference except modules folder includes the small group of elements which get repeated through out the whole website.
A good example for this folder would be a card which we will be using in different pages of the website.
I usually create files for buttons, cards, carousal, gallery, etc. in this folder.
Although I only add code for those modules which have been used at least two times on the website.
If there is an element that is been used on only one page, than I would rather go with 05-pages folder as that folder contains code specific for that page.
