05-pages : This is the place where we either override the CSS code written before for specific pages or we might add new code for that page only.
If I need only one file for a page, then I create file with the page’s name at the root level of this directory.
Sometimes few pages requires more than one files and in that case, I create folder with page’s name in the folder and add files inside that folder.
This way we can easily identify the code for that page.
