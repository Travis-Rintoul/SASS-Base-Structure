02-basic : This is the folder where the CSS code will start which will style your website.
As the name describes, this folder holds all the basic CSS code for the website.
It includes basic styles to tags like section, article , text related tags, grid system, etc.
I like to separate the code in their individual files.
For example, I create typography.scss file which holds all basic styles related to all text elements.
I also create links.scss file if I have several different basic styles for the links on my website.
